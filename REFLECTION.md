## What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I chose common daily activities like waking up, work, exercise, and homework to make the schedule relatable. I then assigned fixed time delays between each activity, aiming for a natural flow that mimicked how a real day progresses. Using emojis for each activity also made the schedule more visually interesting and personal.

## What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
For me the challenge was to add the random "back pain surpise", feet right. Sometimes, the random event would flash very quickly right before another activity, which was visually abrupt. 

## What does this assignment teach you about async code?
This assignment teaches that asynchronous code, using `setTimeout`, allows different parts of a program to run over time without stopping everything else. Unlike a regular script that finishes all its steps instantly from top to bottom, `setTimeout` schedules events to appear one by one with delays, letting other processes continue in the background.

## What creative element did you add?
I added a random "sudden back pain" event as my creative twist. This event appears at an unpredictable time during the simulated day, changing the background color to red and displaying a crying emoji.

## How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
Its able to simlute real-world schedules a bit, by being able to have intervals in between some set in stone and with possiblity of "random" intervals through the use of code. It wont be the most accurate interpertaion but for a simulation with the inention to educate or demonstrate something simple it is effecient.
